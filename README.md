# MyReads Project

This is a React book library project.

## TL;DR

To run the project:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
- Move books on shelves or remove and search for more books.

## Features

- Once ran, a special token is given to the user and the library is populated with books.
- Remove books with selecting None.
- Move shelves with the selec drop down menu.
- Shelves: currently reading, want to read, and already read.
- Search function: query the db for more books (books you already have are shown with the correct shelf)
- Notice not all search queries are possible but they won't break. Try "fitness" or "react" for example.
